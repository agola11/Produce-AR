# Produce-AR


## An immersive iOS AR musical production app that connects to a peripheral to register sounds, in this case a device that can detect foot taps.  Plan on extending it to other peripheral devices as well.

Built with ARKit.

Started off as a 48 hour hackathon project for Reality, Virtually Hackathon 2017 hosted by the MIT Media Lab
